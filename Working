Bats are wonderful creatures. Blind from the eyes but the vision is sharper than humans,
Ultrasonic ranging is the technique used by bats. Ultrasonic sensors provide an easy way in
distance measurement. The sensor is perfect for distance measurements between moving or
stationary objects. Ultrasonic Sensors measure the distance of the objects in air through
non-contact technique. They measure distance without damage and are easy to use and reliable.
These distance measurement sensors connect with all common types of automation and telemetry
equipment. Distance measurement sensors are used to control or indicate the position of objects
and materials. Distance measurement sensors can determine the dimensions of objects such as
height, width and diameter, using one or more sensors. The echo time response of an ultrasonic
sensor detector is based on time of travel after the trigger pulse to the surrounding objects is
non-linear and depends on the reflectance characteristics of the object surface. They offer low
cost and a precision of less than 1 cm in distance measurements of up to 6m.
